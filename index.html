            <h2>Undergraduate Researcher - Tumor Adaptation & Metastasis</h2>
            <p>I am an Undergraduate Researcher focused on studying tumor adaptation and metastasis, particularly translational heterogeneity during lung and bone colonization. I analyze spatial transcriptomics data to explore gene-cell interactions and the genomic changes that drive tumor progression in new environments. Using dimensional reduction and deconvolution methods, I investigate the biological pathways involved in metastasis.</p>
        
            <h2>Machine Learning Fellow - MIT's Break Through Tech AI Program </h2>
            <p>I build models to address business challenges as part of MIT's Break Through Tech AI program. I also work with the Center for Nonprofit Management to develop an NLP-powered chatbot that streamlines user inquiries based on organizational data.</p>
        
            <h2>Instructor - Coding Mind Academy</h2>
            <p>At Coding Mind Academy, I teach and inspire the next generation of coders by creating and delivering Python curricula for K-12 students.</p>
        
            <h2>Founder - Seniors Outreach Organization</h2>
            <p>As the founder of the Seniors Outreach Organization, I spearheaded monthly art distribution initiatives to nursing homes and hosted weekly workshops aimed at raising awareness about social isolation among older adults.</p>
        
            <h2>Expertise</h2>
            <p>My expertise spans spatial transcriptomics, machine learning, data analysis, software development, feature engineering, and instructional design.</p>
