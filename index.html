        <p>I am an Undergraduate Researcher focused on studying tumor adaptation and metastasis, particularly translational heterogeneity during lung and bone colonization. I analyze spatial transcriptomics data to explore gene-cell interactions and the genomic changes that drive tumor progression in new environments. Using dimensional reduction and deconvolution methods, I investigate the biological pathways involved in metastasis.</p>
    
        <p>Additionally, I am a Machine Learning Fellow at MIT's Break Through Tech AI program, where I build models to address business challenges. I am also working with the Center for Nonprofit Management to develop an NLP-powered chatbot that streamlines user inquiries based on organizational data.</p>
    
        <p>Beyond my technical work, I am passionate about teaching and inspiring the next generation of coders at Coding Mind Academy, where I create and deliver Python curricula for K-12 students.</p>
    
        <p>Previously, I founded the Seniors Outreach Organization, where I spearheaded monthly art distribution initiatives to nursing homes and hosted weekly workshops to raise awareness about social isolation among older adults.</p>
    
        <p>My expertise spans cancer research, machine learning, data analysis, software development, feature engineering, and instructional design.</p>
